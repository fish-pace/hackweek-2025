  bio: Chris is a marine ecologist focused on fish ecology and habitat use in near-shore environments. His expertise includes hydrodynamic modeling, species interactions, and the effects of environmental variation on fish distributions and assemblage structure. He is leading efforts to develop habitat-use models for commercially and ecologically important fish species across the U.S. Northeast and Mid-Atlantic continental shelf, with a view toward predicting shifts in distributions under changing environmental conditions.
