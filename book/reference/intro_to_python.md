# Getting started with Python

For those of you who want to learn scientific programming with Python, here is one path you can follow.

## Log into the hackweek JupyterHub

```
workshop.nmfs-openscapes.2i2c.cloud
```
Watch this [video](https://youtu.be/uZ2Uy376Az8?si=Nh3simSYe94c0eEB) for a quick orientation to the JupyterHub.

## For those who are brand new to Python

You might want to start with this basic [Software Carpentries Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/index.html) course. 

* Log into the JupyterHub
* Open and new Jupyter notebook
* Enter code from the course and run
  


## Start with some basic tutorials

[Watch a video](https://youtu.be/scNDbOKZB4A) to see me doing these instructions.

These are by [Robert Johansson](https://jrjohansson.github.io/) author of Numerical Python.

* Log into the JupyterHub
* Open a terminal.
* Type
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures
```
* Open the `ipynb` notebooks and start working through the material.

## Move up to our PACE Workshop tutorials from May 2025

This was a short workshop on PACE data that we gave in May 2025.

* Open a terminal.
* Type
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/EDMW-tutorials-2025
```
* Open the `ipynb` notebooks in the `tutorials` directory.
