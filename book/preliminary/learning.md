*How do I run the tutorials if I don't have Python and all the packages installed?* Once you are in the Fish-PACE Slack, we'll provide a link to our workshop compute environment (a JupyterHub). However, you can run 95% of the tutorials in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). [nice intro to Colab for complete beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi9-W26cDBs).
