# What to Expect 

The {{ hackweek }} will focus on applied, hands-on learning, with participants engaging in
extended periods of small-group work. Our tutorials are designed to offer a broad
snapshot of data science tools to support your applied investigations. Due to the
relatively short duration of our events, we are not able to provide comprehensive,
in-depth training in fundamental tools. Rather, our goal is to inform you about
the types of tools we think are best suited to working with your datasets,
leaving details of implementation to be supported through peer-learning.

## Typical Workflows and Tools

Here are a few specific scenarios of how hackweek participants will engage
with data science tools:

* Connecting to a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) environment and
  accessing content for tutorial training.
* Accessing cloud-hosted remote sensing data using earthaccess and plotting it
 using matplotlib.
* Exploring multi-dimensional remote sensing data using xarray.
* Opening CSV tabular data in Pandas and run tools to conduct satellite matchups.
* Modifying code, committing it to Git and pushing changes to GitHub, for
  others on your team to view and edit.
* Exploring methods for high performance computing such as using Dask and parallelization
* Preparing datasets for machine learning tools, including PyTorch for neural networks

These are examples of the types of activities we will do at the Fish-PACE hackweek in a
collaborative setting. Be aware that most of the project work will be within self-organized that 
teams that are working on a project. Much of the hackweek will be spent running code (via notebooks),
writing code and talking about code. The mentors and organizers will provide links to tutorials and 
help trouble-shoot code, but much of the learning comes from working on a project together.

All tutorials will be in Python using the Pangeo ecosystem of tools for computing in the earth sciences.
For participants wishing to brush up on their skills before
the event, we recommend viewing the resources as described on the 
[Pythia Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html) website. Teams are 
welcome to do their project in R and our compute platform fully supports R for 
earth science computation.
