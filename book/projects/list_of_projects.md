# List of Projects

Hackweek participants will start hashing out project ideas on Oct 6 via Slack. On day 1 of the hackweek, they will self-form into groups of 3-7 and
then get to work. On Day 5, each group will present on their project. Add your project by editing this page in GitHub and putting in a pull-request. We will show you how during the hackweek.
