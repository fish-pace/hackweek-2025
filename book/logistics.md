# Event Logistics

Fish-PACE will be a fully virtual event with a lecture and tutorial block in 11am-2pm Pacific time and two group work times (East and West). Participants and projects will choose a group work time slot that 
works best for their team members. There is no cost for participating in the event. The times of the events are optimized for participants in UTC-4 (Eastern) to UTC-10 (Hawaii). Participants in other time zones are welcome to participate but events will be late night or early morning. [Time Zone Comparison](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20251020T140000&p1=234&p2=179&p3=64&p4=75&p5=18&p6=103&p7=136&p8=83&p9=213&p10=176&p11=248).

No software is required as we will be using a JupyterHub (cloud computing platform) provisioned for the event. Instructions will be provided for those who wish to install software locally. Tutorials will be in Python, but participants and projects are welcome to use Python or R. The JupyterHub is provisioned for geospatial analysis in Python (JupyterLab) or R (RStudio). A basic familiarity to Python will be necessary to follow along with the tutorials; there are many online short courses. For those working in Python for their projects, gaining some familiarity with the `xarray` package is advised. For those working in R for their projects, gaining some familiarity with the `terra`, `stars` and `reticulate` packages is advised.
