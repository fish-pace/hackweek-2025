*When Hurricane Dorian passed over the Bahamas and along the southeastern U.S. coastline, its waves resuspended large quantities of sea-floor sediment, which give the ocean a milky, aquamarine appearance in this composite of VIIRS data collected on Sept. 7, 2019. The browner hues closer to the U.S. shore come from runoff generated by heavy rainfall from the hurricane. Credit: NOAA*


## Developers

### New or updated tutorials

*The following is out of date*

1. Fork or clone the repo.
1. When tutorials are ready to be moved into the Jupyter Book, source the function in `copy_tutorials.py` and then use it to create the unrendered (tutorial repo) and rendered notebooks (book).
2. This will create a branch for you to work on.
3. Switch to that branch and edit `book/_toc.yml` and `book/tutorials/index.md`. Commit those changes to the branch.
4. If there are any images that were created and that you need in the tutorial, then you will need to commit those and push.
5. Create a PR and **label the PR `preview`**. A link to click to create the PR will be shown.
6. After you create the PR (with label `preview`, a link to a netlify preview will appear. Check to ensure that it looks good.
7. Troubleshooting
    * Do you need to change the original tutorial and it is in the gfdl org? Go there and make changes. Then rerun the function in `copy_tutorials.py`.
    * Do you want to add files specific to the hackweek? You can add those, to the pace-2024 repo.
9. Once the PR looks good in netlify, it can be merged.
