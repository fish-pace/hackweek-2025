  description: APPLICATIONS ARE OPEN. Deadline to apply Sept 15, 2025. <a href="https://forms.gle/4DEZMv2CxyyR6Cxz9">Apply Now</a>.<br/><br/>New satellite missions for the ocean environment&mdash;NASA's PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) launched in February 2024 and the upcoming GeoXO (Geostationary Extended Observations)&mdash;are poised to revolutionize ocean color observation by providing much higher spectral resolution and more frequent, near-real-time data. These advanced missions will significantly enhance our ability to monitor dynamic coastal ecosystems, improving both the accuracy and timeliness of environmental assessments and decision-making. In the Fish-PACE hackweek, you will learn to work with the new PACE hyperspectral data and tackle applications for fisheries and ocean ecosystem research.<br><br>Hackweeks are participant-driven events that strive to create welcoming spaces for participants to learn new things, build community and gain hands-on experience with collaboration and team science. During Fish-PACE, we will have a combination of science lectures and coding tutorials and group projects (pitched by participants).
