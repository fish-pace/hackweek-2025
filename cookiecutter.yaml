about:
  description: New satellite missions for the ocean environment&mdash;NASA's PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) and the upcoming GEOXO (Geostationary Ocean Color Observatory)&mdash;are poised to revolutionize ocean color observation by providing much higher spectral resolution and more frequent, near-real-time data. These advanced missions will significantly enhance our ability to monitor dynamic coastal ecosystems, improving both the accuracy and timeliness of environmental assessments and decision-making. The PACE satellite was launched in February 2024. In the Fish-PACE hackweek, you will learn to work with the new PACE hyperspectral data and tackle applications for fisheries and ocean ecosystem research.<br><br>Hackweeks are participant-driven events that strive to create welcoming spaces for participants to learn new things, build community and gain hands-on experience with collaboration and team science. During Fish-PACE, we will have science lectures and coding tutorials in the mornings to get you up and running quickly with PACE data. In the afternoon, you will work on team projects.
